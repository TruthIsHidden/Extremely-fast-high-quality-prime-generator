(All this but now with a ONE-WAY mode, yep you can generate primes now, and your input can not be known as long as your key isnt 1, or any dumb key atleast)
PrimeSearch is an extremely efficient, fast, lightweight,
and deterministic prime producing algorithm, it has
100% efficiency for small to moderate k values,
and even at the 10^18 scale maintained ~91% efficiency

The algorithm itself is basically just a linear piecewise function.
the initial k is multiplied with 30(product of 2, 3 and 5)
then simply put a suitable offset os chosen to add
or subtract. (extremely simple explanation, resd code
for proper explanation).
The described algorithm is option 4 of thr GUI,
or function, "theoreticalmax".

Also its results were tested and proven for k's,
1 --> 100,000 it produced 100% primes and 97 in the 
10^11 range as i said before.

You are free to share or use the algorithm aa you please,
please provide credits and thats it, and feel free,
to provide suggestions and such, consider sharing
the algorithm.

Enjoy.
